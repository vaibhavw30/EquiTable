Especially now.\n\nAn ancient poet from the Bible surveyed his world and it truly looked like everything was falling apart. Yet, he was also a person of faith which led him to conclude:\n\n> _“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases,_\n>\n> _his mercies never come to an end;_\n>\n> _they are new every morning.”_\n>\n> – Lamentations 3:22\n\nThat truly is the gift of faith. To have the assurance of God’s love and grace, no matter what. To have the courage to face any challenge, any change, that might come your way. To know that you are never alone. When you are freed from fear, you are free to boldly serve your neighbor and the world.

We proudly serve the Georgia Tech community in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nGrace House is a community of friendship, direction, authenticity, service, and a home away from home.\n\nIt may seem on the surface that our welcome is just a cup of coffee but really, our welcome is hope.  Hope is needed in a world that seems fraught with division and hope is needed in the lives of Georgia Tech students.  Hope that they will see the other side of a looming midterm, hope that at some point a social life will return, hope that all this hard work is going to be worth it, hope that one day they might have time to sleep, or hope that there is someplace they can still go to get a free cup of coffee, a smile, and for someone to ask “how’s your week going?”. We want to live into that hope for students in all that we do.\n\nGrace House is an Open and Affirming Christian organization, fully living into our Baptismal covenant, especially that part about\n\nSeeking to Serve Christ in ALL Persons, Loving our Neighbor as Ourself & Striving for Justice and Peace Among ALL People, and Respecting the Dignity of EVERY Human Being.\n\nAll Grace House Staff is Safe-Space trained and also trained on Bystander Intervention. We are also a Reconciled in Christ congregation. If at any time you do not feel respected, honored or loved in our home, we would love to talk to you about it and correct it.\n\n# Is Grace House for Me?\n\nOnly you can determine if Grace House is a place for you. But I will describe the typical person at Grace House. If you identify with any of these characteristics and want to know more, head on over to the Join tab. You don’t really have to join anything…we just want to get your contact information in so you can get a little more plugged in.  “Join” was merely a convenient word for the menu. :0)\n\nWho is Grace House? “Grace” is a student. Grace is a dropout. They are graduates affiliated with a church. They are lonely and looking for a place to belong. Grace is old. Grace is young. Grace is looking for something different. Something authentic. Something spiritual. Something meaningful.\n\nGrace is tired. Tired of constantly being “on” and looking like they have it all together. Grace is frustrated with what they see around them, and wants to see the world change from its current state. Yet, they are so burned out, sad, fed up, beat up, irritated, and tired that they desperately need a place of refuge. Grace needs a place to come in and just be. Or cry. Or even just color without any pressure to change, compete, work, like, choose, or please. Grace needs a place to be fed literally and spiritually so they can go back out into the world with renewed hope to keep fighting one more day.\n\n​\n\nGrace might be fed up with the church. They may have left the masjid. They may have no idea what these two words even mean because they didn’t grow up with any religious tradition. Grace feels like loving one’s neighbor is important but doesn’t see anyone doing this in real-time. Grace also feels like social justice isn’t a want but a need. A desperate need. Grace thinks Jesus is pretty cool but doesn’t really see anyone living like or modeling the ways of Jesus, especially those who call themselves “Christians”.\n\n​\n\nFinally, Grace doesn’t have all the answers when it comes to faith and doesn’t pretend to. Sometimes, they aren’t even sure they HAVE faith, much less hope. But they want to seek out answers, maybe struggle with them for a bit, but do so in a safe, nurturing environment. Or maybe, Grace just wants to hear an alternative narrative than what they grew up with and decide for themself what to believe. But Grace sure could use a sounding board on that journey.\n\n​\n\nIf Grace kinda sounds like you, maybe you should look into Grace House.\n\n# Staff\n\n![Pastor Andrew Rickel](https://b3136627.smushcdn.com/3136627/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/05/andrewrickel.jpg?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1)\n\n#### Pastor Andrew Rickel\n\nCampus Pastor & Executive Director\n\nRev.

The gift of giving is the special ability that God gives to certain members of the body of Christ to contribute their material resources to the work of the Lord with liberality and cheerfulness.\n\n### **Fundraising Campaigns**\n\n**What is a Capital Campaign?**\n\nIn January 2015, Ebenezer Baptist Church launched a five-year fundraising campaign to raise $4.5 million dollars to accomplish major capital improvement and debt reduction goals. These goals include: reducing the mortgage principal and improving building and ground facilities; remodeling the Education Building into a Youth Zone; developing a world-class Children’s Chapel, and College and Church School Ministries, including the modernization of classrooms and access to technology to facilitate learning; and investing in and expanding international ministries and programs.\n\n**How can I support the campaign?**\n\nThere are several opportunities for giving to the Ebenezer capital campaign including the Jubilee Legacy Brick Project, Estate Gifts, Ebenezer’s Tympanum bronze relief panel, a one-time capital gift or a multi-year pledge, and the Ebenezer Everywhere Digital Campus. To support the campaign and for additional campaign information, please visit [campaign.historicebenezer.org](http://campaign.historicebenezer.org/).\n\n**Jubilee Brick Campaign**\n\nCelebrate EBC’s past and invest in the future of global social transformation by purchasing a legacy brick to be placed in front of the Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church Horizon Sanctuary and landscaped Prayer Garden. Purchase one or more bricks and cement your family legacy, memorialize a loved one, or recognize your country or organization in the mission of social transformation. Engraved Bricks can be purchased at: 16×16 = $1,000 8×8 = $500 4×8 = $300. [Order Today](http://campaign.historicebenezer.org/index.php/lc/products?search_category_id=3).

Everyone can make a lasting difference and leave a legacy that supports our faith. Through wise estate planning, significant dollars are normally diverted from taxes, probate, and legal costs and redirected to the Lord’s work (without decreasing the amount of inheritance family members will receive)! EBC’s Christian-based estate planning allows members to make generous gifts to their church while they are living, in addition to what they plan to leave after they depart this life. [Contact us for details.](http://campaign.historicebenezer.org/index.php/other-opportunities)\n\n**Ebenezer’s Tympanum Bronze Relief Panel**\n\nAs a member, friend, or both, a legacy gift is an opportunity to make a powerful and enduring declaration of support to “America’s Freedom Church,” Ebenezer Baptist Church. A legacy gift entitles and ensures your name or designated name to be permanently engraved in the Tympanum Bronze Relief Panel affixed to Ebenezer Baptist Church Horizon Sanctuary. [Contact us for details.](http://campaign.historicebenezer.org/index.php/other-opportunities)\n\n**Ebenezer Everywhere Digital Campus**\n\nEbenezer Everywhere will become an international ministries and programs platform, emerging as a global church campus for reaching and teaching the word of God and message of Jesus Christ.Members, guests, partners, donors, leaders, staff, community, and associates will engage, collaborate, and communicate in real-time ministry services, education, events, and activities that are centered around bringing the hearer to Christ and encouraging and equipping people to use their God-given talents and spiritual gifts for individual growth and social transformation.Through expanded reach, this initiative will transform how ministry is shared through a national and global perspective for serving human and social justice needs. [Contact us for details.](http://campaign.historicebenezer.org/index.php/other-opportunities)\n\n**How can I find out more?**\n\nThe Capital Campaign Committee would be happy to assist you in obtaining further information on the programs.\n\n×\n\nESTATE PLANNING\n\nEbenezer Baptist Church provides a way for you to leave a legacy that will support ministry for many years to come.

We believe in human dignity and work every day to help our neighbors meet their most essential needs – housing and food. We specialize in helping unhoused people who face major barriers make the transition to their own homes, and we provide easy access to food for any who need it. We walk alongside the neighbors we serve – respecting each individual's pace and personal decisions.\n\n[OUR STORY](https://www.intowncares.org/our-story)\n\n![95326497_3189103274454389_6885225560700616704_o.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/740813_5dbf086552264d8b9c6de2ce3c0007e3~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_960,h_867,al_c,q_85,enc_avif,quality_auto/740813_5dbf086552264d8b9c6de2ce3c0007e3~mv2.jpg)\n\n![pantry image.png](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/740813_d88c33c461bc4c76911f9276a01cfa90~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_6,h_745,al_c,q_85,enc_avif,quality_auto/740813_d88c33c461bc4c76911f9276a01cfa90~mv2.png)\n\n### At The Table\n\nWhen you don’t know where your next meal will come from, it’s hard to focus on other parts of your life that need attention.\n\nTo alleviate food insecurity for Atlanta neighbors, we make food available twice a week at our pantry – and make deliveries to neighbors who can’t get to the pantry.\n\n​\n\nNourishment is our first priority. We work hard to source healthy food that is often unaffordable and sometimes hard to find – from fresh produce to meat, dairy, and bread. We also supply toiletry kits, pet food, and other essential household items.\n\n## [FOOD PROGRAMS](https://www.intowncares.org/what-we-do)\n\n![MS C.jpeg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/740813_37f6e4ff141f4f0e884a95f5868e29b3~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_953,h_1367,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/740813_37f6e4ff141f4f0e884a95f5868e29b3~mv2.jpeg)\n\n### Home Again\n\n![a8fef757-275f-b1f7-b496-09134b43c1cb (2).png](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/740813_5664842be8e24fccb6d53031f84ed5ee~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_480,h_320,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/a8fef757-275f-b1f7-b496-09134b43c1cb%20(2).png)\n\nWe focus primarily on helping neighbors who face the greatest obstacles to housing, including individuals who have been unable to stabilize with traditional pathways to housing.\n\n​\n\nThe official term for what these neighbors experience is “chronic homelessness.” This means they are:\n\n- repeatedly “unhoused” or lack housing for more than a year; and\n\n- dealing with a disability (mental or physical) or substance use​\n\n\n​\n\nWe help neighbors navigate a complex journey. Our model is based on Housing First – the federal best practice that emphasizes placing people directly into housing and addressing personal obstacles after they are housed rather than as a precondition of housing.
